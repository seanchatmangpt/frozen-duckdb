# STATUS (TR6 2026-09-21): KEPT-UNCERTAIN. Release-time consumer-flow validation: `cargo add
# frozen-duckdb` fetches the PUBLISHED crate from crates.io — pre-publish (pre-TR8) it validates
# the previous release, not this tree. Interactive y/N prompt at the end; scratch project
# frozen-test-project/ is gitignored. Not executed this session — re-verify at TR8 release.
# Validate Frozen DuckDB Approach
# Tests the new approach where each project gets its own ./prebuilt/ directory
